# Gated-Recurrent-Units-and-Deep-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-for-Stock-Price-Prediction
This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for stock price prediction. Stock price prediction implies telling whether a particular stock price will go up or down on a certain day. The model proposed in this paper uses Gated Recurrent Units to take into account the sequential nature of days, which is not handled by CNNs. However, the CNN is used to capture relationships between long term and short term stock patterns. Finally we have a simple feedforward neural network which learns the weights to be given to the CNN prediction and the weight to be given to the GRU prediction.
